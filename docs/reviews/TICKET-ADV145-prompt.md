# TICKET-ADV145 — AI-Assisted Kafka Consumer Config Review Prompt

Review the following Spring Kafka consumer configuration for production readiness. Flag any missing or risky settings in these areas:
  (1) backpressure & poll tuning,
  (2) error handling, retry & DLQ,
  (3) idempotence and exactly-once semantics,
  (4) observability — metrics, logging, traces,
  (5) security — TLS, SASL, ACLs.

For each finding, give the concrete config key, the recommended value, and a one-line justification. Do NOT rewrite the whole file — just list findings.

Application context: trade reconciliation service, ~500 events/sec, strict audit requirements.
